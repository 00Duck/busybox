# BusyBox

Automatically downloads and builds the Linux kernel with BusyBox.

#### Usage

Run `./busybox.sh` in Linux to complete initial setup. Note that this script has only been tested on a Debian distributon. Once finished, run `start.sh` to start a VM with the image.

The VM can be started directly in the terminal by commenting the current command and uncommenting the bottom command.

If you would like to make changes to the init file, use `./reinit.sh`
